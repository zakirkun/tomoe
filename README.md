# ⚡ Tomoe: A Flexible and Fast HTTP Client Library for Go

**Tomoe** is a lightweight and extensible HTTP client library for Go, designed to simplify making HTTP requests while providing flexibility, speed, and robust error handling. It supports generics for type-safe responses, retries, parallel execution, and dynamic body data formats such as JSON, form-data, and file uploads.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **Type-Safe Responses**: Use generics to ensure type safety and reduce boilerplate.
- 🔄 **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for resilient requests.
- ⚡ **Parallel Execution**: Perform concurrent HTTP requests efficiently using Goroutines.
- 📦 **Dynamic Body Support**: Seamlessly handle JSON, form-data, and file uploads.
- 🔧 **Custom Headers and Query Parameters**: Easily configure requests for any use case.
- ⏱️ **Timeouts**: Control request execution time for better resource management.

	ctx := context.Background()

	// Single request with retries
	opts := RequestOptions{
		Method: "GET",
		Path:   "/todos/1",
	}

	response, err := client.Do(ctx, opts)  
    if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Request Error: %v", err.Error())
